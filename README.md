# Implementation of AES and Diffie-Hellman key exchange in group projects

## Overview

## Descriptions
🔳AES Algorithm\
•	 block cipher with 128 bit block size 
\
•	 three key lengths must be supported: 128, 192 and 256 bit 
\
•	 the number of internal rounds of the cipher is a function of the key length according to Table 4.1. 
\
•	 Galois field arithmetic is used in most layers
